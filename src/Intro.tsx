				<p>Jamie,</p>
				<p>
					I'm so sorry how long it's been since we last spoke. I've had my head
					down on my research for quite some time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Remember back 16 years ago, the team in Beijing proved the existence
					of parallel universes. Remember I started working on a theory based on
					their paper about how these other universes could be accessed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Well... It's true, it can and has been done. But not by us, by other
					universes. Jamie, we've been accessed by them.
				</p>
				<p>We have work to do. Please come.</p>
